This article shows how to build a custom hook in React.js for `login` in Firebase authentication. Code is found on [GitHub](https://github.com/call-n/example-firebase) for reference.

## How to build custom login hook

This article is very similar to the one were we build a signup hook, anyways. First of you should navigate to your `/hooks` directory there you will create a new file called `useLogin.js`. Use this code as a start template:

```js:/src/hooks/useLogin.js
import { useState } from 'react'

export const Login = () => {
    // more to come... :)
}
```

We also need to import the necessary modules from `firebase/firestore` and our config like this:

```js
// import the firebase modules and our config
import { auth } from '../Firebase/config'
import { signInWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";
```

`auth` is a reference to the server, very similar to the `db` we used the database functions.

`signInWithEmailAndPassword` mostly explains it self, sign in with a user with `email` and `passaword`. It takes 3 arguments and that is the `auth` object, user and an email.

After this we keep on coding the hook and placing out required state, function and return. Looks something like this:

```js
import { useState } from "react";

export const useLogin = () => {
    const [error, setError] = useState(null)

    const login = () => {
        // login code
    }

    return { error, login }
}
```

Then we will write the `login` function:

```js
const login = (email, password) => {
    setError(null) 
    signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
        .then((res) => {
            console.log('User logged in:', res.user)
        })
        .catch((err) => {
            setError(err.message)
        })
}
```

`signInWithEmailAndPassword` has 3 parameter as I told you before and when that promise has returned we get back the `res`, in other word, respons. This just tells us if it worked if not we use the `.catch` method and `setError` with the `error.message`.

Nothing too complicated really! Here is the finished custom hook.

### Finished code

```js:/src/hooks/useLogin
import { useState } from 'react'

// import the firebase functions
import { auth } from '../Firebase/config'
import { signInWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";


export const useLogin = () => {
    const [error, setError] = useState(null)

    const login = (email, password) => {
        setError(null) 
        signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
            .then((res) => {
                console.log('User logged in:', res.user)
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                setError(err.message)
            })
    }

    return { error, login }
}
```

After this you need a form to collect the email and email, and this is how you would import and use the login hook in a component:

```js
import { useLogin } from '../hooks/useLogin'

export default function Login() {
    //...
    const { error, login } = useLogin()
    

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault()
        login(email, password)
    }
//...
```
