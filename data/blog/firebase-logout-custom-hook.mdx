This article shows how to code a custom hook for loggin out a user in Firebase with React.js. Code is found on [GitHub](https://github.com/call-n/example-firebase) for reference.

## How to build custom logout hook

First of start by adding a new file to the `/hook` directory called `useLogout.js`. Add the following code for a code template and the imports.

```js
// import the firebase functions
import { auth } from '../Firebase/config'
import { signOut } from "firebase/auth";

export const useLogout = () => {
    // rest of logic for hook
}
```

`auth` in this context is a token that every logged in user gets. When we want to do something to their session/token we call the auth object. 

`signOut` takes one argument, the `auth` object. It has all the necessary information that Firebase needs to `logout` the user from their session.

As you can image this custom hook is nothing complicated.

### Finished code

```js:/src/hooks/useLogout.js
// import the firebase functions
import { auth } from '../Firebase/config'
import { signOut } from "firebase/auth";

export const useLogout = () => {

    const logout = () => {
        signOut(auth)
            .then(() => {
                console.log('User signed out')
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                console.log(err.message)
            })
    }

    return { logout }
}
```

We just call the `signOut` function from Firebase and send thru the `auth` object and it's finished.
