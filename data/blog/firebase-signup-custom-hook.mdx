This article shows how to build a custom hook in React.js for `signup` in Firebase authentication. Code is found on [GitHub](https://github.com/call-n/example-firebase) for reference.

## How to build custom signup hook

First of you should navigate to your `/hooks` directory or if you've placed them elsewhere and create a new file called `useSignup.js`. Use this code as a start template:

```js:/src/hooks/useSignup.js
import { useState } from 'react'

export const useSignup = () => {
    // more to come... :)
}
```

We also need to import the necessary modules from `firebase/firestore` and our config like this:

```js
// import the firebase modules and our config
import { auth } from '../Firebase/config'
import { createUserWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";
```

`auth` is a reference to the server, very similar to the `db` we used the database functions.

`createUserWithEmailAndPassword` mostly explains it self, create a `user` with `email` and `passaword`. It takes 3 arguments and that is the `auth` object, user and an email.

Then on to building it out some more, we need a state for error, a function called `signup` that we want to export for usage in other compontent and that looks something like this:

```js
import { useState } from "react";

export const useSignup = () => {
    const [error, setError] = useState(null)

    const signup = () => {
        // signup logic
    }

    return { error, signup }
}
```

Then we will write the `signup` function:

```js
const signup = (email, password) => {
    setError(null) 
    createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
        .then((res) => {
            console.log('User signed up:', res.user)
        })
        .catch((err) => {
            setError(err.message)
        })
}
```

`createUserWithEmailAndPassword` has 3 parameter as I told you before and when that promise has returned we get back the `res`, in other word, respons. This just tells us if it worked if not we use the `.catch` method and `setError` with the `error.message`.

Nothing too complicated really! Here is the finished custom hook.

### Finished code

```js:/src/hooks/useSignup
import { useState } from "react";

// import the firebase functions
import { auth } from '../Firebase/config'
import { createUserWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";

export const useSignup = () => {
    const [error, setError] = useState(null)

    const signup = (email, password) => {
        setError(null) 
        createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
            .then((res) => {
                console.log('User signed up:', res.user)
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                setError(err.message)
            })
    }

    return { error, signup }
}
```

Now for all this to work we need a Form with email and password and then use our `signup` function that we import to our component like this:

```js
import { useSignup } from '../hooks/useSignup'

export default function Signup() {
    //...
    const { error, signup } = useSignup()
    

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault()
        signup(email, password)
    }
//...
```
