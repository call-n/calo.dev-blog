How to setup Firebase Authentication and links to related articles. This example is in React.js and I recommend that you read [How to setup Firebase in your code](https://calo.dev/blog/firebase-setup-code) before you read this. All code is found on [GitHub](https://github.com/call-n/example-firebase) for reference.

> This is a really short article, this will only contain how to configure your `config.js` file and the links to all the other articles on authentication.

Let's move on, first we have to import the `firebase/auth` module in the `/Firebase/config.js` file with the function `getAuth`. Like this:

```js
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth'
```

Then all we have to do is to invoke it and export the auth constant we declared:

```js
// initialise authentication service
const auth = getAuth()

export { auth }
```

## Enable Firebase Auth on the cloud

First of we need to navigate to our `console` in the cloud and click on the `Authentication` link in the `Build tab`. When we do that this view pops up:

Then we want to procced by clicking on the `get started` button, after this we will be sent to this screen and we want to choose `Email/Password` for this custom hook.

Then they will ask you to enable this setting and like in the image below just enable the one with `Email/Password` for now. Procced by clicking on the save button then you are all done!

> And that's it! Now the authentication service will be up and running so you can just import the config file anywere in your project to get started.
