I think in my case this is because when i deleted docker and updated to the latest version of macOS and it did something to my permissions. Take this command and set your usr in the MYUSRNAME within the curlybrackets.

```bash
sudo chown -R $(MYUSRNAME):admin /usr/local/* \&& sudo chmod -R g+rwx /usr/local/*
```

Once you've got brew running again just run this command and wait, it will reinstall all your packages.

```bash
brew list | xargs brew reinstall.
```

Then you should be all set again
